# Loyola COMP 271 Project 11: list performance

## Group activity

In this activity, we'll evaluate the performance of array-based vs. linked lists.

# Objectives

An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

- algorithmic complexity
- runtime performance
  - how to measure
  - how it relates to algorithmic complexity
- abstract data types (ADT)
- array-based versus linked lists
- getting started with iterators
- automated unit testing using JUnit
  - testing for exceptions
  - test fixtures and assertions
  
# Instructions

The key idea is to think about this lab like a physics experiment! 
You will set it up and then take measurements.

1. Review the code.
1. Fix the syntax errors (if any, though there probably aren't any).
2. Run the code for various inputs to gain an understanding of what it does.
3. Complete the items marked TODO in the code and get the tests to pass.
2. Conduct the performance measurements: you will find the running times in the test report.
4. Create a markdown document called Answers.md and answer the various questions embedded in the code.

# Grading (total 5)

- 1.5 tests passing and completion of items marked TODO
- 1.5 performance testing for increasing problem sizes
- 2 written part
  - 1.5 responses to the questions above
  - 0.5 grammar, style, formatting
- 0.5 (optional extra credit) DRY in performance testing 
- 1 (optional extra credit) shared spreadsheet with performance data and charts (include URL in Answers.md)
