# Loyola COMP 271 Lab 10: performance of array-based vs. linked lists

## Group activity

Collaborate with your teammates but submit individually.
Clearly list the members of your team.

# Objectives

An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

- algorithmic complexity
- runtime performance
  - how to measure
  - how it relates to algorithmic complexity
- abstract data types (ADT)
- array-based versus linked lists
- getting started with iterators
- automated unit testing using JUnit
  - testing for exceptions
  - test fixtures and assertions
  
# Instructions

The key idea is to think about this lab like a physics experiment! 
You will set it up and then take measurements.

1. Review the code.
1. Fix the syntax errors (if any, though there probably aren't any).
2. Run the code for various inputs to gain an understanding of what it does.
3. Complete the items marked TODO in the code and get the tests to pass.
2. Conduct the performance measurements: you will find the running times in the test report.
4. Create a markdown document called Answers.md and answer the various questions embedded in the code.

# Submission

- Make sure you have created a separate project for this activity.
- Include a project-specific readme file including your reflection and any other thoughts or design decisions.
- In IDEA, export your project as a zip file and submit as an attachment.
